n, m = map(int, input().split())
# You can access the j-th element in the i-th row of matrix A using a[i][j].
# Works the same for B. Just make sure 0 <= j < n and 0 <= i < m.
a = [[int(val) for val in input().split()] for _ in range(n)]
b = [[int(val) for val in input().split()] for _ in range(n)]

# Good luck! I believe in you! :)
